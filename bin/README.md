# Ender-3-Max
Marlin 2.1.1 configuration for Ender 3 Max with CR Touch mounted with the OEM mount. If you are using the BL Touch with a different mount you may need to adjust the probe offset values and compile the firmware yourself. Search for `NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET` in **Configuration.h**.

Turn the printer off, Copy **firmware-20220716-113441.bin** to your SD card, insert the card into the printer and turn it on. It will take 10 to 15 seconds to update. The screen will be blank during this process.

This firmware is provided as-is and you agree to assume all risk when you download it and apply it to your printer.
