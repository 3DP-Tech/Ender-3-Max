# Ender-3-Max 
Marlin 2.0.x configuration for Ender 3 Max with CR Touch/BL Touch.

These files are based on the bug fix branch and were compiled on September 28th, 2021.

The **Configuration** folder containsthe files needed to compile the firmware. The bin folder contains a pre-compiled binary that can be applied to the printer.

The configuration is compiled with the board name `BOARD_CREALITY_V4` targeted for verion 4.2.2 of the controller board. Use `STM32F103RET6_creality` in ***platform.ini***.

This may work on other versions of the board, but it will not work on 4.2.7.
